hey, if it matters or helps if you ever see this in the future, this repository was inspired by the day I spoke Hebrew to you, blending together what Rabbi Levinsky and Ruth Bader Ginsburg made me feel like, trapped that day inside Latter-day Saints hospital.

חסד, חסד
את רוצה ללחת.

It was a blend of the rabbi driving a full 30-60 minutes from Park City down to Salt Lake City to see me. we talked about a lot of stuff. When he said "please, please--take your medicine!" it reminded me of that verse ppl were quiting wuot f quoting after RBG died--justice, justice, you shall pursue!

I had been taking Hebrew lessons for making aliyah, so i had a devent decnt le devent decent legel level if basic grammar in my memory. chesed, chesed, at rotzah lalechet

I think I already uploaded it; howvee i lovd howevrr however I love this picture snd and it's nice to have it twice. My ex Ku Kn (not Ku Klux Klan) -- I learned yesterday how to like overcome parts of my disability and truncate names, for broey. Anyway, he said that Pikesville was uppity. He said a lot of cool things. I remember one time we played lacrosse in HS against an eastern Maryland team that was definitely not in Baltimore County. Someone called my Kuntokine someone called me Kuntokinte as one lf the many one of the many variants of insulting my lacrosse skills lol. Anyway Ku Kn is kind of like that. 

I also met a guy on TikTok from--fosh gosh he explained it--Calvert County Maryland? best guess. he sat down one day and explained to me that his county is the lne one immediately next to ours--to the East I think?--and I guess because I didn't have a map I wasn't able to follow along. His talent was farting a lot and he eventually made an OnlyFans out of it, though I've never watched it. He is saved on my favorites though.

I bought Georgetown Nick a book called Baltimore Noir. one story from Baltimore Noir and one story from Long Island Noir really related to him, I felt. The Baltimore Noir one, was whichever story was marked Pikesville. It was just interesting--the climax was a woman saying "do you think I don't know what the Bible says? I read the Bible too." It's just a different way than Judaism felt to me in Maryland. Great story to read though. Ciol to cool to see Judaism reeesented represented in pop culture. unorthodox and my unorrhodoz life were my unirthodox my unorrhodox unorthodox life were mindblowing too

well, whats most meaningful to me rn is pictures and the easiest way to upload pics is jere here on the readme page, so I'm i might maknly mainly make upsdtes updates here for you
